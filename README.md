# Cryptography Resource Portal for IIIT Delhi

## Project Overview

This project aims to construct a comprehensive website dedicated to cryptography education, specifically focusing on the courses **Applied Cryptography** and **Topics in Cryptanalysis** offered at IIIT Delhi. The website will serve as a centralized platform for students to access detailed course content, previous class materials, and a curated database of publicly available cryptographic resources. Additionally, machine learning techniques will be applied to generate summaries of resource materials, allowing students to easily grasp key concepts from each chapter.

## Objectives

### Course Information Repository
- Provide detailed descriptions and curricula for the **Applied Cryptography** and **Topics in Cryptanalysis** courses.
- Include prerequisites, learning outcomes, and course objectives to help students and instructors navigate the topics covered.

### Course Archive
- Maintain a database of materials from previous classes of the courses, such as:
  - Lecture slides
  - Assignments and exams
  - Notes
- Allow students to access past resources for reference and revision.

### Resource Database
- Curate a comprehensive database of publicly available resources related to cryptography, including:
  - Textbooks
  - Research papers
  - Tutorials
  - Video lectures
- Categorize resources by topic for easy navigation.

### Machine Learning Integration
- Develop a machine learning model that automatically generates summaries for each chapter or section of the available resources.
- Summaries will be concise, providing quick overviews of complex cryptographic topics, helping students understand the material more efficiently.

### Upcoming Projects and Events
- Feature a section for upcoming cryptography-related projects, conferences, and events.
- Help students stay informed about opportunities for further involvement in the cryptography community.

## Key Features

### Course Details Pages
For each course (Applied Cryptography and Topics in Cryptanalysis), provide the following sections:
- **Course Overview**: Introduction to the subject, importance, and relevance.
- **Syllabus**: List of topics covered, such as encryption algorithms, cryptographic protocols, cryptanalysis techniques, etc.
- **Learning Objectives**: What students will be able to accomplish upon completing the course.
- **Assignments and Exams**: Links to past assignments, quizzes, and exam papers.
- **Instructor Information**: Details of the course instructor(s) and contact information.

### Past Class Resources
- Archive materials from previous classes, including:
  - Lecture slides and recordings
  - Past assignments and solutions
  - Exam papers and model answers
  - Reading lists and recommended resources

### Public Resource Database
- Categorize cryptographic resources into different topics.
- Each resource will be linked to relevant online materials like textbooks, journal articles, research papers, video lectures, and tutorials.
- Tag each resource for easy searchability (e.g., keywords, topics, difficulty levels).

### ML-Based Chapter Summaries
- Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze the content of each chapter or section from the public resources.
- Generate concise summaries that highlight the core concepts, key formulas, and essential takeaways.
- Implement a "summary generation" feature where students can input a chapter or section title and receive a quick, easy-to-read summary of the content.

### Upcoming Projects and Events Section
- A calendar or events feed that lists:
  - Upcoming conferences, seminars, and workshops on cryptography and cryptanalysis.
  - Project collaboration opportunities, internships, and research openings in the field.
  - Hackathons or competitions focused on cryptography.

### User Interaction and Community Features
- Discussion boards or forums where students can post questions, share resources, and collaborate.
- A feedback system to rate the usefulness of resources and ML-generated summaries.
- Option to bookmark favorite resources or save custom summaries.
